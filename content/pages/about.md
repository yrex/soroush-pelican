Hi, I'm **Soroush Javidi**, welcome to my website!

I'm interested in data, [signal processing](http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/), finance, machine learning, algorithms and the intersection of these. I graduated with a PhD from [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was designing several classes of both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms for brain-computer interfacing and renewable energy problems. My research was Awarded the Eryl Cadwaladr Davies Prize for best doctoral thesis of 2010-2011. A list of [my academic publications](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=3EIqI4wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) is available on Google Scholar.

I am now working as a quantitative developer, creating and supporting tactical tools for risk and P&L management. I work with a wide spectrum of instruments: bonds, futures, interest rate swaps, FX swaps, FX options and exotic products. My tools of trade are Python, VBA, C# and SQL.

I also like running, brewing good coffee (_yes, I'm one of those people!_), design and serendipitous music discovery.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](#) and also see what I've been building on [GitHub](https://github.com/yrex), or, be old-school and send me an email on `< my name dot surname at this domain >`.
